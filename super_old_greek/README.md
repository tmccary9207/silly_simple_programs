# Super Old Greek Formatter?

In the days old people wrote without spaces and punctuation. Since the trend is all about retro you can't get any further back than this (at least when it comes to formatting Greek I would assume).

## What should this program do?

Good question! It should remove all space, punctuation, periods, semicolons, apostrophes [from the Greek word ap√≥strophos] and question marks. But that's too simple because really ancient Greeks wearing their hipster sunglasses didn't even use lower case letters or accents. So, to be ancient Greek hipsters ourselves it'll need to do this too, yay!

## Test File?

For a test file I found every Greek accented letter and regular letter as well as the capitalized form. With all those letters I put them into `test_text.txt` and what the modified text should be after running the program in `correct_output.txt`.

## What should the procedures be?

1. Replace unicode characters `\u0370` to `\u03FF` with nothing.
2. Replace all non letters with nothing.
3. Uppercase all letters remaining.
4. Profit! (Wait, what?)

## Languages I've done this in...

### NodeJS/Ecmascript

This one isn't that difficult. For the sake of sanity I removed the newline from the correct output file that my editor automatically adds. Before any text replacement can happen the string needs to be normalized to `NFD` (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/normalize). Essentially, the string normalization turns the accent marks into characters instead of them being characters with accents. With the string normalized, removing accent marks as well as all non Greek characters eliminates all that needs to be removed. After that all that is left is to uppercase the string. Easy enough I guess, the regex is doing the heavy lifting here. To look at the unicode reference I would suggest, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_and_Coptic , as a good start.
